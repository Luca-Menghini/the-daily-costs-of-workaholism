# Aims and content

The present document includes the analytical steps implemented to compute the descriptive statistics from the retrospective and daily diary data collected with the Qualtrics platform (Qualtrics, Seattle, WA, USA) from an heterogeneous samples of workers over two weeks, pre-processed as shown in [Supplementary Material S3](https://Luca-Menghini.github.io/the-daily-costs-of-workaholism/S3_preProcessing/S3_data-processing-code-and-output.html) and aggregated as shown in [Supplementary Material S4](https://Luca-Menghini.github.io/the-daily-costs-of-workaholism/S4_psychometrics/S4_psychometrics-code-and-output.html). The document also depicts the procedure used to **select the covariates** to be included in the following multilevel models (see [Supplementary Material S6](https://Luca-Menghini.github.io/the-daily-costs-of-workaholism/S6_modeling/S6_modeling-code-and-output.html)).

Here, we remove all objects from the R global environment.
```{r  }
# removing all objets from the workspace
rm(list=ls())
```

The following R packages are used in this document (see [References](#ref) section):
```{r  }
# required packages
packages <- c("knitr","Rmisc","Hmisc","lme4","ggplot2","reshape2","MuMIn")

# generate packages references
knitr::write_bib(c(.packages(), packages),"packagesDesc.bib")

# # run to install missing packages
# xfun::pkg_attach2(packages, message = FALSE); rm(list=ls())
```

<br>

# 1. Data reading

First, we read daily diary dataset `diary` and we rebuild the preliminary questionnaire `prelqs` exported from the previous step ([Supplementary Material S4](https://Luca-Menghini.github.io/the-daily-costs-of-workaholism/S4_psychometrics/S4_psychometrics-code-and-output.html)).
```{r  }
# loading data
load("DATI/diary_aggregated.RData") 

# rebuilding the prelqs dataset (only including variables from the preliminary questionnaire)
prelqs <- diary[!duplicated(diary$ID),c(1,which(colnames(diary)=="gender"):ncol(diary))]

# original sample sizes
cat("diary:",nrow(diary),"responses (days) from",nlevels(diary$ID),"participants")
cat("prelqs:",nrow(prelqs),"responses from",nlevels(prelqs$ID),"participants")
```

<br>

# 2. Data filtering

As we [pre-registered here](https://osf.io/h9zvq), we filter the data based on participant compliance with the protocol, that is we **exclude the participants with less than 3 full days of participation** (i.e., with nonmissing response to the afternoon, evening, and morning questionnaire).
```{r  }
# filtering participants with less than 3 observations
clean <- diary[0,]
for(ID in levels(diary$ID)){ 
  if(nrow(diary[diary$ID==ID & diary$aft==1 & diary$eve==1 & diary$mor==1,]) >= 3){ 
    clean <- rbind(clean,diary[diary$ID==ID,]) }}
clean$ID <- as.factor(as.character(clean$ID)) # resetting ID levels
clean_prelqs <- prelqs[prelqs$ID %in% levels(clean$ID),] # filtering prelqs data
clean_prelqs$ID <- as.factor(as.character(clean_prelqs$ID)) # resetting ID levels
cat("diary: Excluded",nlevels(diary$ID)-nlevels(clean$ID),"participants and",nrow(diary)-nrow(clean),"observations")

# updating sample sizes
cat("diary:",nrow(clean),"responses from",nlevels(clean$ID),"participants")
prelqs <- prelqs[prelqs$ID %in% levels(clean$ID),] # filtering prelqs data
prelqs$ID <- as.factor(as.character(prelqs$ID)) # resetting ID levels
cat("prelqs:",nrow(prelqs),"responses from",nlevels(prelqs$ID),"participants")
```

<br>

# 3. Descriptives

First, we describe the sample and compute the descriptive statistics and correlations of the core study variables (i.e., workaholism, `WHLSM`; afternoon, evening, and morning blood pressure, `SBP_aft`, `DBP_aft`, `SBP_eve` `DBP_eve`; emotional exhaustion, `EE`; sleep disturbances, `SD`, and recovery experiences, `RDet` and `RRel`) and a set of potential quantitative covariates (i.e., workhours, `workHours`; time since waking-up, `hhFromAwake`; age, `age`; BMI, `BMI`, and weekly working hours, `weekHours`).

The following packages and functions are used to optimize the analysis.

## 3.1. Sample description

Here, we describe the sample by providing frequencies and other descriptive statistics of sociodemographic and work-related variables collected with the preliminary questionnaire, considering the included subsample.
```{r }
# gender (freq; %)
summary(prelqs$gender); round(100*summary(prelqs$gender)/nrow(prelqs),1)

# age (mean, SD)
round(mean(prelqs$age),2); round(sd(prelqs$age),2)

# smoking status (freq; %)
summary(prelqs$smoker); round(100*summary(prelqs$smoker)/nrow(prelqs),1)
```

<br>

## 3.2. Response rate

Here, we report the total number of observations and response rate for each variable, considering the included subsample.
```{r  }
# total number of diary entries, days, and participants
cat(nrow(clean[clean$aft==1,])+nrow(clean[clean$eve==1,])+nrow(clean[clean$mor==1,]),"diary entry,",
    nrow(clean),"daily observations from",nlevels(clean$ID),"participants")

# computing Nweeks, Nobs, and complDays variables
prelqs$Nweeks <- prelqs$complObs <- prelqs$complDays <- 1
for(i in 1:nrow(prelqs)){
  if(max(clean[clean$ID==prelqs[i,"ID"],"day"])>6){ prelqs[i,"Nweeks"] <- 2 } # No. of weeks
  prelqs[i,"complObs"] <- nrow(clean[clean$ID==prelqs[i,"ID"] & clean$aft==1,]) + # No. of complete observations
    nrow(clean[clean$ID==prelqs[i,"ID"] & clean$eve==1,]) + nrow(clean[clean$ID==prelqs[i,"ID"] & clean$mor==1,])
  prelqs[i,"complDays"] <- nrow(clean[clean$ID==prelqs[i,"ID"] & clean$aft==1 & clean$eve==1 & clean$aft==1,]) } # No. full days
cat("Sanity check:",min(prelqs$complDays)==3 & max(prelqs$Nweeks)==2) # min 3 complete days and max 2 weeks

# number and % of participants involved for 1 vs. 2 weeks
summary(as.factor(prelqs$Nweeks))
round(100*summary(as.factor(prelqs$Nweeks))/nrow(prelqs),1)

# computing respRate
prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==1,"respRate"] <- round(100*prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==1,"complObs"]/15,2) # max 15 obs when Nweeks = 1
prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==2,"respRate"] <- round(100*prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==2,"complObs"]/30,2) # max 30 obs when Nweeks = 2

# computing complDaysRate
prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==1,"complDaysRate"] <- round(100*prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==1,"complDays"]/5,2) # max 5 days when Nweeks = 1
prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==2,"complDaysRate"] <- round(100*prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==2,"complDays"]/10,2) # max 10 days when Nweeks = 2

# printing info
cat("- No. complete responses per participants:",round(mean(prelqs$complObs),2),", SD =",round(sd(prelqs$complObs),2),
    "\n- response rate per participants:",round(mean(prelqs$respRate),2),"%, SD =",round(sd(prelqs$respRate),2),
    "%\n- No. complete days (Aft + Eve + Mor) per participants",round(mean(prelqs$complDays),2),

    "participants involved for two weeks (",round(100*nrow(prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==2,])/nrow(prelqs)),
    "% )\n- mean No. of complete responses for those participating over 2 weeks =",
    round(mean(prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==2,"complObs"]),2),
    "\n- mean No. of complete responses for those participating over 1 week =",
    round(mean(prelqs[prelqs$Nweeks==1,"complObs"]),2))
```

<br>

## 3.3. Blood pressure subsample

In addition to filtering participant based on their compliance, we pre-registered the **exclusion of all participants reporting taking blood pressure medications `bp_drugs` or suffering from a cardiovascular dysfunction `cv_dysf` from the analyses of blood pressure**. Here, we describe such excluded participants and the subsample of participants included in blood pressure analyses.
```{r  }
# filtering participants with bp_drugs or cv_dysf
BPout <- prelqs[prelqs$bp_drugs=="Yes" | prelqs$cv_dysf=="Yes",]
BPin <- prelqs[prelqs$bp_drugs=="No" & prelqs$cv_dysf=="No",]

# sample size for blood pressure
cat(nrow(clean[clean$ID %in% levels(as.factor(as.character(BPin$ID))),]),"ovservations (days) from",
    nlevels(as.factor(as.character(BPin$ID))),"participants included in BP analyses")

# sociodemographics in excluded participants
summary(BPout$gender); 100*summary(BPout$gender)/nrow(BPout) # gender (freq; %)
mean(BPout$age); sd(BPout$age) # age (mean, SD)
mean(BPout$BMI); sd(BPout$BMI) # BMI (mean, SD)

# response rate in included participants
cat("- No. complete responses per participants:",round(mean(BPin$complObs),2),", SD =",round(sd(BPin$complObs),2),
    "\n- response rate per participants:",round(mean(BPin$respRate),2),"%, SD =",round(sd(BPin$respRate),2),
    "%\n- No. complete days (Aft + Eve + Mor) per participants",round(mean(BPin$complDays),2),
    ", SD =",round(sd(BPin$complDays),2),"\n- complete days rate per participants:",round(mean(BPin$complDaysRate),2),
    "%, SD =",round(sd(BPin$complDaysRate),2),"%","\n-",nrow(BPin[BPin$Nweeks==2,]),"on",nrow(BPin),
    "participants involved for two weeks (",round(100*nrow(BPin[BPin$Nweeks==2,])/nrow(BPin)),"% )")
```

<br>

## 3.4. Quantitative variables

Here, we use the `multidesc()` function for computing the descriptive statistics (mean, SD and ICC) of level-1 and level-2 variables. We can see that `WHLSM` shows an ICC of .60, indicating that most variance is located at the between-individual level, but within-individual variance is still substantial. Similar results are shown by blood pressure (ICC ranging from .61 to .73) and emotional exhaustion (ICC = .56), whereas higher proportions of within-individual variability are estimated for `SD`, `RDet`, and `RRel`.
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# selecting level-1 quantitative variables
lv1 <- c("WHLSM","SBP_aft","DBP_aft", # afternoon
         "SBP_eve","DBP_eve","EE","PD", # evening
         "SD") # next morning

# selecting level-2 quantitative variables
lv2 <- c("age","BMI")

# computing descriptives
desc <- multidesc(long=clean,wide=prelqs,lv1=lv1,lv2=lv2)
kable(desc)
```

<br>

### 3.4.1. Survey duration

Here, we inspect the mean, standard deviation, and distribution of diary survey durations. We can see that, after excluding a few outliers taking more than 30 minutes, the average response time to diary surveys was 4.02 minutes (SD = 3.51 min).
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.width=10,fig.height=3}
# computing durations in minutes
clean$dur_aft <- difftime(clean$end_aft,clean$start_aft,units="mins")
clean$dur_eve <- difftime(clean$end_eve,clean$start_eve,units="mins")
clean$dur_mor <- difftime(clean$end_mor,clean$start_mor,units="mins")
vars <- paste0("dur_",c("aft","eve","mor"))
clean[,vars] <- lapply(clean[,vars],as.numeric)
clean$dur_mean <- apply(clean[,c("dur_aft","dur_eve","dur_mor")],1,mean,na.rm=TRUE)

# plotting durations
par(mfrow=c(1,4)); for(Var in c(vars,"dur_mean")){ 
  hist(clean[,Var],breaks=100,main=paste(Var,"N =",length(na.omit(clean[,Var])))) }

# No. cases > 30 min (8 to 15)
for(Var in c(vars,"dur_mean")){ 
  colnames(clean)[which(colnames(clean)==Var)] <- "Var"
  cat(Var,"> 60 min:",nrow(clean[!is.na(clean$Var) & clean$Var > 30,]),"  ") 
  colnames(clean)[which(colnames(clean)=="Var")] <- Var }

# mean and standard deviation (in minutes) without considering such outliers
round(mean(clean$dur_mean[clean$dur_mean<30],na.rm=TRUE),2)
round(sd(clean$dur_mean[clean$dur_mean<30],na.rm=TRUE),2)

# removing variables
clean[,c(vars,"dur_mean")] <- NULL
```

<br>

## 3.5. Correlations

Second, we use the `multicorr` function to compute the between-individual (shown below the main diagonal) and the within-individual correlations (shown above the main diagonal) among the same continuous variables.
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
cors <- multicorr(long=clean,wide=prelqs,lv1=lv1,lv2=lv2)
kable(cors)
```

<br>

Correlations are also graphically visualized below (blue = negative, white = uncorrelated, red = positive).
```{r  fig.width=12,fig.height=8,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(melt(as.matrix(multicorr(long=clean,wide=prelqs,lv1=lv1,lv2=lv2))),aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + geom_tile() + 
  geom_text(aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, label = round(value,2)),color="black",size=5)+labs(x="",y="") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="darkblue",high="#f03b20",mid="white",midpoint=0,limit = c(-1,1), space = "Lab",
                       guide="legend",breaks=round(seq(1,-1,length.out = 11),2))+
  theme(text=element_text(face="bold",size=10),axis.text.x=element_text(angle=30))
```

<br>

## 3.6. Univariate distributions

Fourth, we visualize the univariate distributions of the focal variables, for each class of variables. We can see that level-1 self-reported predictors show quite skewed distributions. However, person-mean centered scores are approximately normally distributed.
```{r fig.width=12,fig.height=6}
# level-2
par(mfrow=c(3,6)); for(Var in c(lv2,"gender","edu","mStatus","home_partner","children","home_child","position","sector",

## 3.7. Bivariate distributions {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Fifth, we visualize the distribution of each focal variable (i.e., workaholism, blood pressure, emotional exhaustion, and sleep disturbances) and potential covariate against the following categorical variables:

1. **Demographics**: `gender`, educational level `edu`, marital status `mStatus` and living with a partner `home_partner`, having children `children` and living with children `home_child`, job position `position` and `sector`

2. **Inclusion criteria**: blood pressure `bp_drugs`, hormonal `horm_drugs`, and psychoactive medication `psy_drugs`, cardiovascular `cv_dysf` and sleep dysfunctions `sleep_dysf`

3. **Level-2 confounders**: being a smoker `smoker` or a careless respondent `careless` 

4. **Level-1 confounders**: daily nonwork hassles in the evening `dailyHassles_eve`, presence of late working hours in the evening `lateWorkHours`, atypical response times `flagTime`

5. **Level-1 covariates**: survey location in the afternoon `where_aft`, remote working `teleWork`

6. **BP confounders**: aggregated confounders score `confounders_aft` and `confounders_eve`; coffee `coffe_aft`, `coffe_eve`; smoking `smoke_aft`, `smoke_eve`; vigorous physical activity `sport_aft`, `sport_eve`, having a meal `meal_aft`, `meal_eve`; and flagged BP cases `flagBP_aft`, `flagBP_eve` (see [Supplementary Material S3](https://Luca-Menghini.github.io/the-daily-costs-of-workaholism/S3_preProcessing/S3_data-processing-code-and-output.html))

# 4. Covariate selection

As pre-registered, for maximizing model parsimony while minimizing the risk of non-convergence, the covariates to be included in the following regression analyses are selected based on an **empirical approach** accounting for the following criteria:

1. The No. of cases in each level, prioritizing categorical covariates with **balanced number of cases**

2. The bivariate distributions and correlations with the response variable, prioritizing covariates showing **some potential covariance trend** with the response variable

3. Linear modeling, prioritizing the covariates whose inclusion as predictor of the corresponding response variable shows **stronger evidence** (i.e., higher Akaike weight) than more parsimonious models and **absolute t-value of 2 or higher**

However, deviating from the pre-registration (see [Supplementary Material S7](https://osf.io/bprvg)), we also consider **theoretical arguments** concerning some important covariates. Particularly, we prioritize level-1 over level-2 covariates as our study is focused on within-individual relationships. Moreover, following [Spector (2021)](#ref), we attempt to avoid risking to rule out variables acting as potential exploratory mechanisms (e.g., mediators) of the focused relationships. Theoretical arguments are detailed below for each response variable.

The following packages are used to optimize the analyses.
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(lme4); library(MuMIn)
```

<br>

## 4.1. Afternoon BP

For afternoon systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the pre-registered potential covariates to be considered are:

1. `gender`, in light of the robust literature on sex differences in blood pressure and hypertension (e.g., [Sandberg & Ji, 2012]), with gender having been highlighted as a potential moderator of the straining effects of trait workaholism (e.g., [Bladucci et al., 2018; 2021](#ref)).

2. `age`, in light of the consolidated relationship between aging and high blood pressure; however, no clear differences have been highlighted on the relationship between age and workaholism ([Clark et al., 2016](#ref)).

3. `BMI`, in light of the robust literature on the increased risk for hypertension and CVD in individuals with higher BMI (e.g., [Gregg et al., 2005](#ref)); however, no clear differences have been highlighted, to our knowledge, on the relationship between BMI and workaholism.

4. Participants' smoking status `smoker`, in light of the widely acknowledged relationship between smoking and hypertension; however, no clear differences have been highlighted, to our knowledge, on the relationship between smoking status and workaholism.

5. The daily number of worked hours `workHours`, as long working hours is a definitional aspect of workaholism which has been found positively associated with higher blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks ([Virtanen, 2012](#ref)); however, controlling for this variable might risk to artificially deflate the relationship between workaholism and blood pressure since the former might influence the latter through working hours. That is, working hours is a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the focused relationship, and including it as a control variable might bias rather than strengthening the results (see [Spector et al., 2021](#ref)).

6. Remote work `teleWork`, although with no clear expectations on its relationship with blood pressure, while we originally hypothesized that remote working might act as a moderator of the straining effect of workaholism.

7. BP `confounders_aft` identifying behavioral factors (e.g., smoking, physical activity) that might affect blood pressure, although with no clear expectation on their relationship with workaholism. 

Further pre-registered level-2 covariates (i.e., retrospective measures of trait workaholism, technostress creators) are not included due to our aim to focus the study on the focused level-1 variables, whereas recovery experiences will be included in all models. Moreover, we do not include the previous BP measure as we focus on the covariance of intra-individual fluctuations between workaholism and blood pressure, rather than the change of the latter over time (see [Supplementary material S7](https://osf.io/bprvg)). In contrast, additional (i.e., not pre-registered) level-2 covariates potentially moderating the relationship between workaholism and afternoon blood pressure are considered as potentially confounding factors.

Prior to evaluate the inclusion of each covariate, we prepare the data for the analyses. That is, we remove cases of missing responses in the response variable or any covariate (**list-wise deletion**) and we center level-1 continuous covariates on the individual mean (**person-mean-centering**). Moreover, we apply our inclusion criteria by removing all cases with `bp_drugs` or `cv_dysf = "Yes"`. 
```{r }
# inclusion criteria
cleanBP <- clean[clean$bp_drugs=="No" & clean$cv_dysf=="No",]

# list-wise deletion

### 4.1.1. gender {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`gender` is a categorical variable with a roughly balanced number of participants. In section 3.5 we observed some tendency with higher `SBP_aft` in men than in women. Consistently, its inclusion in the null model shows improved evidence (i.e., higher Akaike weight) compared to the null model, although the estimated t-value is lower than 2, with a particularly low value for `DBP_aft`. In both cases, also considering its theoretical relevance as a potential moderator of the straining effects of workaholism (e.g., [Balducci et al. (2018; 2021)](#ref)) **we include `gender` as a covariate**.

### 4.1.2. age {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`age` is a level-2 continuous variable that in section 3.2 showed moderate-to-strong positive relationships with blood pressure (*r* from .42 to .52). Consistently, its inclusion in the model including `gender` implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value higher than 2. Thus, despite the uncertainty on its relationship with workaholism, we **include `age` as a covariate** for afternoon blood pressure.

#### SBP_aft
```{r }

### 4.1.3. BMI {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`BMI` is a level-2 continuous variable that in section 3.2 showed weak-to-moderate positive relationships with blood pressure (*r* from .28 to .43). Consistently, its inclusion in the model including `gender` and `age` implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value higher than 2. Thus, despite the uncertainty on its relationship with workaholism, we **include `BMI` as a covariate** for afternoon blood pressure.

#### SBP_aft

### 4.1.4. smoker {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`smoker` is a level-2 categorical variable that in section 3.5 did not show substantially relationships with blood pressure. Consistently, both models show an absolute t-value lower than 2, although its inclusion implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models. Also considering the uncertainty of its relationship with workaholism, we **do not include** it as a covariate for afternoon blood pressure.

### 4.1.5. WorkHours {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`workHours` is a level-1 continuous variable that in section 3.2 was weakly correlated with afternoon blood pressure (*r* = .12-.04). Here, its inclusion implies stronger evidence (i.e., higher Akaike weight) than more parsimonious models, with an estimated absolute t-value higher than 2. However, we consider the theoretical importance of this variable, which might be a potential explanatory mechanism (e.g., mediator) through which workaholism might impact on blood pressure, and thus, **we do not include** it as a covariate for afternoon blood pressure.

#### SBP_aft
```{r }

### 4.1.6. teleWork {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`teleWork` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 only showed some slight difference in afternoon blood pressure. Here, whereas its inclusion implies weaker evidence than more parsimonious models, absolute t-values are lower than 2. Thus, also considering the unbalanced number of cases per level and the uncertainty of its relationship with both workaholism and blood pressure, **we do not include** it as a covariate for afternoon blood pressure.

### 4.1.7. confounders_aft {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`confounders_aft` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 only showed some slight difference in afternoon blood pressure. Consistently, its inclusion implies weaker evidence than more parsimonious models. However, absolute t-values are lower than 2. Thus, also considering the unbalanced number of cases per level and the uncertainty of its relationship with  workaholism, **we do not include** it as a covariate for afternoon blood pressure.

### 4.1.8. Other covariates {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

In addition to the pre-registered covariates, we consider a **further level-2 covariate** that in section 3.5 showed substantial trends in both afternoon blood pressure and workaholism, and whose potential influence on both variables can be theoretically argued, namely having **children** `children` or living with children `home_child`. Indeed, respondents reporting to live with their children reported higher afternoon blood pressure, whereas those reporting to have children reported slightly lower workaholism (see section 3.5). Theoretically, it is plausible although not consistently reported by previous research (see [Clark et al., 2016](#ref)) that workaholism levels and overall investment in the work vs. family domain are influenced by family needs and presence of children in the household. On the other hand, family needs and living with children might negatively impact on blood pressure. Thus, both `children` and `home_child` might be a common external variable influencing both workaholism and afternoon, and we consider it as a further potential covariate.

Although both `children` and `home_child` have an acceptably balanced number of cases per level and both imply stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, none of them show an absolute *t* value higher than 2. Thus, also in this case, **we do not include** these two variables as covariates for afternoon blood pressure.

### 4.1.9. Time trends {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

As a final, not pre-registered, control, we inspect the **linear time trends** of the outcome variable. This is done by including the number of `day`s since the beginning of the study as a further covariate. We can see that the inclusion of `day` does not imply stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute *t* value lower than 2. Thus, we chose to **not include** `day` as a covariate for afternoon blood pressure.

## 4.2. Evening BP

For evening systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the pre-registered potential covariates to be considered are:

1. `gender`, in light of the robust literature on sex differences in blood pressure and hypertension (e.g., [Sandberg & Ji, 2012]), with gender having been highlighted as a potential moderator of the straining effects of trait workaholism (e.g., [Bladucci et al., 2018; 2021](#ref)).

2. `age`, in light of the consolidated relationship between aging and high blood pressure; however, no clear differences have been highlighted on the relationship between age and workaholism ([Clark et al., 2016](#ref)).

3. `BMI`, in light of the robust literature on the increased risk for hypertension and CVD in individuals with higher BMI (e.g., [Gregg et al., 2005](#ref)); however, no clear differences have been highlighted, to our knowledge, on the relationship between BMI and workaholism.

4. Participants' smoking status `smoker`, in light of the widely acknowledged relationship between smoking and hypertension; however, no clear differences have been highlighted, to our knowledge, on the relationship between smoking status and workaholism.

5. The daily number of worked hours `workHours`, as long working hours is a definitional aspect of workaholism which has been found positively associated with higher blood pressure and other cardiovascular risks ([Virtanen, 2012](#ref)); however, controlling for this variable might risk to artificially deflate the relationship between workaholism and blood pressure since the former might influence the latter through working hours. That is, working hours is a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the focused relationship, and including it as a control variable might bias rather than strengthening the results (see [Spector et al., 2021](#ref)).

6. The occurrence of late working hours in the evening `lateWorkHours`, consistently with what argued above for `workHours`; also in this case, controlling for this variable might risk to rule out a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the relationship between workaholism and blood pressure.

7. Nonwork hassles in the evening `dailyHassles_eve`, as hassles have been related to high blood pressure (e.g., [Nyklíček et al. 1999](#ref)) and nonwork hassles such as relationship tension have been recently related to state workaholism ([Clark et al., 2021](#ref)); also in this case, such an argument imply that nonwork hassles are a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the focused relationship.

8. Remote work `teleWork`, although with no clear expectations on its relationship with blood pressure, while we originally hypothesized that remote working might act as a moderator of the straining effect of workaholism.

9. BP `confounders_eve` identifying behavioral factors (e.g., smoking, physical activity) that might affect blood pressure, although with no clear expectation on their relationship with workaholism. 

Further pre-registered level-2 covariates (i.e., retrospective measures of trait workaholism, technostress creators) are not included due to our aim to focus the study on the focused level-1 variables, whereas recovery experiences will be included in all models. Moreover, we do not include the previous BP measure as we focus on the covariance of intra-individual fluctuations between workaholism and blood pressure, rather than the change of the latter over time (see [Supplementary material S7](https://osf.io/bprvg)). In contrast, additional (i.e., not pre-registered) level-2 covariates potentially moderating the relationship between workaholism and evening blood pressure are considered as potentially confounding factors.

Prior to evaluate the inclusion of each covariate, we prepare the data for the analyses. That is, we remove cases of missing responses in the response variable or any covariate (**list-wise deletion**) and we center level-1 continuous covariates on the individual mean (**person-mean-centering**). Moreover, we apply our inclusion criteria by removing all cases with `bp_drugs` or `cv_dysf = "Yes"`.

### 4.2.1. gender {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`gender` is a categorical variable with a roughly balanced number of participants. In section 3.5 we observed some tendency with higher `SBP_aft` in men than in women. Consistently, its inclusion in the null model shows improved evidence (i.e., higher Akaike weight) compared to the null model, although the estimated t-value is lower than 2, with a particularly low value for `DBP_eve`. In both cases, also considering its theoretical relevance as a potential moderator of the straining effects of workaholism (e.g., [Balducci et al. (2018; 2021)](#ref)) **we include `gender` as a covariate** for evening blood pressure.

### 4.2.2. age {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`age` is a level-2 continuous variable that in section 3.2 showed moderate-to-strong positive relationships with blood pressure (*r* from .42 to .52). Consistently, its inclusion in the model including `gender` implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value higher than 2. Thus, despite the uncertainty on its relationship with workaholism, we **include `age` as a covariate** for evening blood pressure.

### 4.2.3. BMI {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`BMI` is a level-2 continuous variable that in section 3.2 showed weak-to-moderate positive relationships with blood pressure (*r* from .28 to .43). Consistently, its inclusion in the model including `gender` and `age` implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value higher than 2. Thus, despite the uncertainty on its relationship with workaholism, we **include `BMI` as a covariate** for evening blood pressure.

### 4.2.4. smoker {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`smoker` is a level-2 categorical variable that in section 3.5 did not show substantially relationships with blood pressure. Consistently, both models show an absolute t-value lower than 2 when the other covariates are considered, although its inclusion implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models. Also considering the uncertainty of its relationship with workaholism, we **do not include** it as a covariate for evening blood pressure.

### 4.2.5. WorkHours {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`workHours` is a level-1 continuous variable that in section 3.2 was not substantially correlated with evening blood pressure (*r* = .03-.06). Here, its inclusion implies weaker evidence (i.e., lower Akaike weight) than more parsimonious models, with an estimated absolute t-value lower than 2. Thus, also considering the theoretical importance of this variable, which might be a potential explanatory mechanism (e.g., mediator) through which workaholism might impact on blood pressure, **we do not include** it as a covariate for evening blood pressure.

### 4.2.6. lateWorkHours {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`lateWorkHours` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 only showed slight differences in evening systolic blood pressure. Consistently, its inclusion implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value higher than 2 for `SBP_eve`. However, we consider its role as a potential explanatory mechanism (e.g., mediator) through which workaholism might impact on blood pressure. Thus, also in light of the unbalanced number of cases, **we do not include** it as a covariate for evening blood pressure.

### 4.2.7. dailyHassles_eve {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

`dailyHassles_eve` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 predicted slightly higher evening systolic blood pressure. Consistently, its inclusion implies stronger evidence (i.e., higher Akaike weight) than more parsimonious models, with an estimated absolute t-value higher than 2 for both systolic and diastolic evening blood pressure. However, the variable shows a strongly unbalanced number of cases, with only 10% of cases with some evening hassle. Moreover, we consider the theoretical importance of this variable, which might be a potential explanatory mechanism (e.g., mediator) through which workaholism might impact on strain. Thus, **we do not include** it as a covariate for evening blood pressure.

`teleWork` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 only showed some slight difference in evening blood pressure. Here, although its inclusion implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, absolute t-values are lower than 2.

### 4.2.10. Other covariates {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

In addition to the pre-registered covariates, we consider a **further level-2 covariate** that in section 3.5 showed substantial trends in both evening blood pressure and workaholism, and whose potential influence on both variables can be theoretically argued, namely having **children** `children` or living with children `home_child`. Indeed, respondents reporting to live with their children reported higher evening blood pressure, whereas those reporting to have children reported slightly lower workaholism (see section 3.5). Theoretically, it is plausible although not consistently reported by previous research (see [Clark et al., 2016](#ref)) that workaholism levels and overall investment in the work vs. family domain are influenced by family needs and presence of children in the household. On the other hand, family needs and living with children might negatively impact on blood pressure. Thus, both `children` and `home_child` might be a common external variable influencing both workaholism and evening, and we consider it as a further potential covariate.

Although both `children` and `home_child` have an acceptably balanced number of cases per level and both imply stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, none of them show an absolute *t* value higher than 2. Thus, also in this case, **we do not include** these two variables as covariates for evening blood pressure.

### 4.2.11. Time trends {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

As a final, not pre-registered, control, we inspect the **linear time trends** of the outcome variable. This is done by including the number of `day`s since the beginning of the study as a further covariate. We can see that the inclusion of `day` implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute *t* value higher than 2. However, a better inspection of blood pressure distributions through `day` levels shows that such effect is likely due to measurement reactivity (i.e., increased physiological activation during the first - less familiar - blood pressure recordings). Consistently the linear time trend is no longer substantial after the removal of observations collected on the first day, whereas the effect is larger when `day` is included as a categorical variable with day 1 vs. other days. Thus, we **do not include** `day` as a covariate** for evening blood pressure, but we will consider it as a robustness check.

## 4.3. Emotional Exhaustion

For emotional exhaustion, the pre-registered potential covariates to be considered are: 

1. `gender`, as previous evidence highlighted higher emotional exhaustion in women compared to men (e.g., [Purvanova et al 2010](#ref)) and gender has been highlighted as a potential moderator of the straining effects of trait workaholism (e.g., [Bladucci et al., 2018; 2021](#ref)).

2. `age`, as previous evidence highlighted some emotional exhaustion trend over age (e.g., [Brewer et al., 2004](#ref)); however, no clear differences have been highlighted for workaholism over age ([Clark et al., 2016](#ref)).

3. The daily number of worked hours `workHours`, as long working hours is a definitional aspect of workaholism which has been found associated with emotional exhaustion ([Seidler et al, 2014](#ref)); however, controlling for this variable might risk to artificially deflate the relationship between workaholism and sleep disturbances since the former might influence the latter through working hours. That is, working hours is a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the focused relationship, and including it as a control variable might bias rather than strengthening the results (see [Spector et al., 2021](#ref)).

5. The occurrence of late working hours in the evening `lateWorkHours`, consistently with what argued above for `workHours`; also in this case, controlling for this variable might risk to rule out a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the relationship between workaholism and sleep disturbances.

7. Nonwork hassles in the evening `dailyHassles_eve`, as private life hassles have been related to emotional exhaustion (e.g., [Klusmann et al., 2021](#ref)) and nonwork hassles such as relationship tension have been recently related to state workaholism ([Clark et al., 2021](#ref)); also in this case, such an argument imply that nonwork hassles are a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the focused relationship.

8. Remote work `teleWork`, as emotional exhaustion might be different during remote work days (e.g., [Abdel Hadi et al., 2021](#ref)), although with no clear expectations on its relationship with workaholism.

Further pre-registered level-2 covariates (i.e., retrospective measures of trait workaholism, technostress creators) are not included due to our aim to focus the study on the focused level-1 variables, whereas recovery experiences will be included in all models (see [Supplementary material S7](https://osf.io/bprvg)). Blood pressure confounders are not considered as well, due to the lack of clear link with exhaustion and workaholism. In contrast, additional (i.e., not pre-registered) level-2 covariates potentially moderating the relationship between workaholism and emotional exhaustion are considered as potentially confounding factors.

Prior to evaluate the inclusion of each covariate, we prepare the data for the analyses. That is, we remove cases of missing responses in the response variable or any covariate (**list-wise deletion**) and we center level-1 continuous covariates on the individual mean (**person-mean-centering**).

### 4.3.1. gender

`gender` is a categorical variable with a roughly balanced number of participants. In section 3.5 we did not observed substantial gender differences in emotional exhaustion. Consistently, its inclusion in the null model shows weaker evidence (i.e., lower Akaike weight), with an estimated t-value lower than 2. However, considering its theoretical relevance as a potential moderator of the straining effects of workaholism (e.g., [Balducci et al. (2018)](#ref)) **we include `gender` as a covariate** for sleep disturbances.
```{r }
# number of cases by covariate level
summary(cleanEE[!duplicated(cleanEE$ID),"gender"]) # No. participants
summary(cleanEE$gender) # No. cases

# model comparison
m0 <- lmer(EE ~ (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
m1 <- lmer(EE ~ gender + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence including gender
summary(m1)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2
```

<br>

### 4.3.2. age

`age` is a level-2 continuous variable that in section 3.2 was uncorrelated with emotional exhaustion (*r* = 0.00). Consistently, its inclusion in the model including `gender` implies weaker evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value lower than 2. Thus, also considering the uncertainty on its relationship with workaholism, **we do not include** it as a covariate for emotional exhaustion.
```{r }
# model comparison vs null
m1.bis <- lmer(EE ~ age + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1.bis)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than null model
summary(m1.bis)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2

# model comparison vs gender
m2 <- lmer(EE ~ gender + age + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1,m2)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than previous model
summary(m2)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2
```

<br>

### 4.3.3. workHours

`workHours` is a level-1 continuous variable that in section 3.2 was positively correlated with emotional exhaustion (*r* = 0.22). Consistently, its inclusion implies stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value higher than 2. However, considering its role as a potential explanatory mechanism (e.g., mediator) through which workaholism might impact on strain, **we do not include** it as a covariate for emotional exhaustion.
```{r }
# model comparison vs null
m1.bis <- lmer(EE ~ workHours.mc + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1.bis)) # Akaike weights: stronger evidence than null model
summary(m1.bis)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| > 2

# model comparison vs gender
m2 <- lmer(EE ~ gender + workHours.mc + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1,m2)) # Akaike weights: stronger evidence than previous model
summary(m2)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| > 2
```

<br>

### 4.3.4. lateWorkHours

`lateWorkHours` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 did not predict substantial differences in emotional exhaustion. Consistently, its inclusion implies weaker evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value lower than 2. Thus, also considering its role as a potential explanatory mechanism (e.g., mediator) through which workaholism might impact on strain, **we do not include** it as a covariate for emotional exhaustion.
```{r }
# number of cases by covariate level
summary(cleanEE$lateWorkHours)

# model comparison vs null
m1.bis <- lmer(EE ~ lateWorkHours + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1.bis)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than null model
summary(m1.bis)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2

# model comparison vs gender
m2 <- lmer(EE ~ gender + lateWorkHours + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1,m2)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than previous model
summary(m2)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2
```

<br>

### 4.3.5. dailyHassles_eve

`dailyHassles_eve` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 predicted higher emotional exhaustion. Consistently, its inclusion implies stronger evidence (i.e., higher Akaike weight) than more parsimonious models, with an estimated absolute t-value higher than 2. However, the variable shows a strongly unbalanced number of cases, with only 10% of cases with some evening hassles. Moreover, we consider the theoretical importance of this variable, which might be a potential explanatory mechanism (e.g., mediator) through which workaholism might impact on strain. Thus, **we do not include** it as a covariate for emotional exhaustion.
```{r }
# number of cases by covariate level
summary(cleanEE$dailyHassles_eve)

# model comparison dailyHassles_eve vs null
m1.bis <- lmer(EE ~ dailyHassles_eve + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1.bis)) # Akaike weights: stronger evidence than null model
summary(m1.bis)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| > 2

# model comparison vs gender
m2 <- lmer(EE ~ gender + dailyHassles_eve + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1,m2)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than previous model
summary(m2)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| > 2
```

<br>

### 4.3.6. teleWork

`teleWork` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 did not predict substantial differences in emotional exhaustion. Consistently, its inclusion implies weaker evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value lower than 2. Thus, also considering the unbalanced number of cases per level and the uncertainty of its relationship with workaholism, **we do not include** it as a covariate for emotional exhaustion.
```{r }
# number of cases by covariate level
summary(cleanEE$teleWork) # currently 4 categories
cleanEE$teleWork <- as.factor(gsub("both","teleWork",gsub("dayOff","teleWork",cleanEE$teleWork))) # recoding to 2 categories
summary(cleanEE$teleWork)

# model comparison vs null
m1.bis <- lmer(EE ~ teleWork + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1.bis)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than null model
summary(m1.bis)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2

# model comparison vs gender + dailyHassles_eve
m2 <- lmer(EE ~ gender + teleWork + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1,m2)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than previous model
summary(m2)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2
```

<br>

### 4.3.7. Other covariates

In addition to the pre-registered covariates, we consider a **further level-2 covariate** that in section 3.5 showed substantial trends in both emotional exhaustion and workaholism, and whose potential influence on both variables can be theoretically argued, namely having `children` or living with children `home_child`. Indeed, respondents reporting to live with their children showed lower emotional exhaustion, whereas those reporting to have children reported slightly lower workaholism (see section 3.5). Theoretically, it is plausible although not consistently reported by previous research (see [Clark et al., 2016](#ref)) that workaholism levels and overall investment in the work vs. family domain are influenced by family needs and presence of children in the household. Thus, both `children` and `home_child` might be a common external variable influencing both workaholism and emotional exhaustion, and we consider it as a further potential covariate.

Although both `children` and `home_child` have an acceptably balanced number of cases per level, none of them implied stronger evidence than the more parsimonious models. Thus, also in this case, **we do not include** these two variables as covariates for emotional exhaustion.
```{r }
# children...........................................................

# number of cases by covariate level
summary(cleanEE[!duplicated(cleanEE$ID),"children"]) # children: No. participants
summary(cleanEE$children) # children: No. cases

# model comparison home_child vs null
m1.bis <- lmer(EE ~ home_child + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1.bis)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than null model
summary(m1.bis)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2

# model comparison children vs gender
m2 <- lmer(EE ~ gender + children + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1,m2)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than previous model
summary(m2)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2

# home_child...........................................................

summary(cleanEE[!duplicated(cleanEE$ID),"home_child"]) # home_child: No. participants
summary(cleanEE$home_child) # home_child: No. cases

# model comparison children vs null
m1.bis <- lmer(EE ~ children + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1.bis)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than null model
summary(m1.bis)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2

# model comparison home_child vs gender
m2 <- lmer(EE ~ gender + home_child + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1,m2)) # Akaike weights: weaker evidence than previous model
summary(m2)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| < 2
```

<br>

### 4.3.8. Time trends

As a final, not pre-registered, control, we inspect the **linear time trends** of the outcome variable. This is done by including the number of `day`s since the beginning of the study as a further covariate. We can see that the inclusion of `day` implies stronger evidence than the null model unless the model only including `gender` is considered, with a t-value higher than 2. However, we cannot see a clear linear trend of `EE` over time. Thus, we **do not include** `day` as a covariate for emotional exhaustion, but we will consider it as a robustness check.
```{r }
# plotting SD by day
boxplot(EE ~ day,data=cleanEE)

# model comparison day vs null
m1.bis <- lmer(EE ~ day + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1.bis)) # Akaike weights: stronger evidence than null model
summary(m1.bis)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| > 2

# model comparison day vs gender + dailyHassles_eve
m2 <- lmer(EE ~ gender + day + (1|ID),data=cleanEE)
Weights(AIC(m0,m1,m2)) # Akaike weights: same evidence than previous models
summary(m2)$coefficients # coefficient: |t| > 2
```

<br>

## 4.4. Sleep disturbances

For sleep disturbances, the pre-registered potential covariates to be considered are: 

1. `gender`, as previous evidence highlighted poorer sleep quality in women compared to men (e.g., [Zeng et al., 2022](#ref)) and gender has been highlighted as a potential moderator of the straining effects of trait workaholism (e.g., [Bladucci et al., 2018; 2021](#ref)).

2. `age`, as previous evidence highlighted poorer sleep quality in aging (e.g., [Floyd et al., 2000](#ref)); however, no clear differences have been highlighted for workaholism over age ([Clark et al., 2016](#ref)).

3. The time since waking up `hhFromAwake`, as perceived sleep disturbances might change with the time between awakening and the subsequent survey response; however, we have no clear expectation on its relationship with workaholism, and the two variables are uncorrelated (*r* = 0.02).

4. The daily number of worked hours `workHours`, as long working hours is a definitional aspect of workaholism which has been found associated with sleep disturbances ([Virtanen, 2009](#ref)); however, controlling for this variable might risk to artificially deflate the relationship between workaholism and sleep disturbances since the former might influence the latter through working hours. That is, working hours is a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the focused relationship, and including it as a control variable might bias rather than strengthening the results (see [Spector et al., 2021](#ref)).

5. The occurrence of late working hours in the evening `lateWorkHours`, consistently with what argued above for `workHours`; also in this case, controlling for this variable might risk to rule out a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the relationship between workaholism and sleep disturbances

7. Nonwork hassles in the evening `dailyHassles_eve`, as hassles have been related to sleep disturbances (e.g., [Dahl et al., 2007](#ref)) and nonwork hassles such as relationship tension have been recently related to state workaholism ([Clark et al., 2021](#ref)); also in this case, such an argument imply that nonwork hassles are a **potential explanatory mechanism** of the focused relationship.

8. Remote work `teleWork`, although with no clear expectations on its relationship with sleep disturbances, while we originally hypothesized that remote working might act as a moderator of the straining effect of workaholism.

Further pre-registered level-2 covariates (i.e., retrospective measures of trait workaholism, technostress creators) are not included due to our aim to focus the study on the focused level-1 variables, whereas recovery experiences will be included in all models (see [Supplementary material S7](https://osf.io/bprvg)). In contrast, additional (i.e., not pre-registered) level-2 covariates potentially moderating the relationship between workaholism and sleep disturbances are considered as potentially confounding factors.

Prior to evaluate the inclusion of each covariate, we prepare the data for the analyses. That is, we remove cases of missing responses in the response variable or any covariate (**list-wise deletion**) and we center level-1 continuous covariates on the individual mean (**person-mean-centering**).
```{r }
# list-wise deletion
cleanSD <- as.data.frame(na.omit(clean[,c("ID","day","SD",
                                        "gender","age","workHours","hhFromAwake","lateWorkHours",
                                        "dailyHassles_eve","teleWork",
                                        "home_child","children")]))
cat("Considering",nrow(cleanSD),"complete observations from",nlevels(as.factor(as.character(cleanSD$ID))),"participants")

# mean centering lv-1 continuous covariates

  prelqs <- cbind(prelqs,aggregate(cleanSD[,Var],list(cleanSD$ID),mean)[,2]) # computing individual means

```

<br>

### 4.4.1. gender

`gender` is a categorical variable with a roughly balanced number of participants. Although in section 3.5 we only observed some slight tendency, its inclusion in the null model shows improved evidence (i.e., higher Akaike weight) compared to the null model, with an estimated t-value close to 2. Thus, also considering its theoretical relevance as a potential moderator of the straining effects of workaholism (e.g., [Balducci et al. (2018)](#ref)) **we include `gender` as a covariate** for sleep disturbances.
```{r }

### 4.4.2. age

`age` is a level-2 continuous variable that in section 3.2 was unrelated with sleep disturbances (*r* = 0.02). Consistently, its inclusion in the model including `gender` implies weaker evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value lower than 2. Thus, also considering the uncertainty on its relationship with workaholism, **we do not include** it as a covariate for sleep disturbances.
```{r }

Consistently, its inclusion implies weaker evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value lower than 2. Thus, also considering the uncertainty of its relationship with both workaholism and sleep disturbances, **we do not include** it as a covariate for sleep disturbances.
```{r }

`workHours` is a level-1 continuous variable that in section 3.2 was uncorrelated with sleep disturbances (*r* = 0.02). Consistently, its inclusion implies weaker evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value lower than 2. Thus, also considering its role as a potential explanatory mechanism (e.g., mediator) through which workaholism might impact on strain, **we do not include** it as a covariate for sleep disturbances.

`lateWorkHours` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 did not predict substantial differences in sleep disturbances. Consistently, its inclusion implies weaker evidence than more parsimonious models, with an absolute t-value lower than 2. Thus, also considering its role as a potential explanatory mechanism (e.g., mediator) through which workaholism might impact on strain, **we do not include** it as a covariate for sleep disturbances.

### 4.4.6. dailyHassles_eve

`dailyHassles_eve` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 predicted slightly higher sleep disturbances. Consistently, its inclusion implies stronger evidence (i.e., higher Akaike weight) than more parsimonious models, with an estimated absolute t-value higher than 2.

`teleWork` is a level-1 categorical variable that in section 3.5 did not predict substantial differences in sleep disturbances.

In addition to the pre-registered covariates, we consider a **further level-2 covariate** that in section 3.5 showed substantial trends in both sleep disturbances and workaholism, and whose potential influence on both variables can be theoretically argued, namely having **children** `children` or living with children `home_child`. Indeed, respondents reporting to live with their children reported slightly higher sleep disturbances, whereas those reporting to have children reported slightly lower workaholism (see section 3.5). Theoretically, it is plausible although not consistently reported by previous research (see [Clark et al., 2016](#ref)) that workaholism levels and overall investment in the work vs. family domain are influenced by family needs and presence of children in the household. On the other hand, family needs and living with children have been shown to negatively impact on sleep disturbances (e.g., [Gay et al., 20040](#ref)). Thus, both `children` and `home_child` might be a common external variable influencing both workaholism and sleep disturbances, and we consider it as a further potential covariate.

Although both `children` and `home_child` have an acceptably balanced number of cases per level, none of them implies stronger evidence than the more parsimonious models. Thus, also in this case, **we do not include** these two variables as covariates for sleep disturbances.

### 4.4.9. Time trends

As a final, not pre-registered, control, we inspect the **linear time trends** of the outcome variable. This is done by including the number of `day`s since the beginning of the study as a further covariate. We can see that the inclusion of `day` does not imply stronger evidence than more parsimonious models, although a negative time trend (|*t*| > 2) is estimated for sleep disturbances. Thus, we chose to **not include** `day` as a covariate for sleep disturbances.
```{r }
# plotting SD by day
boxplot(SD ~ day,data=cleanSD)

# model comparison day vs null
m1.bis <- lmer(SD ~ day + (1|ID),data=cleanSD)

# 6. Outputs

Finally, we generate and export the outputs to be included in the manuscript, namely the table with the descriptive statistics and correlations that only includes the focused variables and the selected covariates.
```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# selecting level-1 quantitative variables
lv1 <- c("WHLSM","SBP_aft","DBP_aft", # afternoon
         "SBP_eve","DBP_eve","EE","PD", # evening
         "SD") # next morning
lv2 <- c("age","BMI")

# computing descriptives
tab1 <- cbind(multidesc(long=clean,wide=prelqs,lv1=lv1,lv2=lv2),
              multicorr(long=clean,wide=prelqs,lv1=lv1,lv2=lv2,pvalue=TRUE,correction="BH"))
write.csv(tab1,"RESULTS/Table1.csv",row.names=FALSE)
kable(tab1)
